#This is a student repository from UP221: Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science at UCLA with an introduction to python.
#I am a second year urban planning student with concentrations in design and the environment
#I am interested in having projects and a learning community to practice python. I had done some self-guided learning in the past, but it felt too theoretical disconnected from being able to apply it to statistical or map analyses. I also was never really a fan of ArcGIS so am curious if I'll like this method.
#I am interested in projects that are at the intersection of climate change and vulnerable populations. I am interested in hazards, heat and wildfires, and adaptation approaches through a spatial justice lens. I would also be interested in connections between climate risk and migration.
